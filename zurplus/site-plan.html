      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Zurplus is a sustainable, nonprofit resource-sharing platform that
        connects businesses with leftover materials to those who can repurpose
        them, fostering a circular economy. Our mission is to promote recycling
        and repurposing across the United States, America, and eventually the
        globe.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        We prioritize large manufacturing companies, followed by startups, SMEs,
        community groups, and local governments, providing them a platform to
        reduce waste and drive environmental change.
      </p>

      <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
      <p>
        In Zurplus, JavaScript will be used to create an interactive experience
        with features like search, sorting, and filtering of listings by waste
        type. The code will be organized into multiple functions—for instance,
        an initFilters() function to set up event listeners, a filterListings()
        function that uses conditional branching (if/else) to decide which
        listings match the user's criteria, and a renderListings() function to
        update the DOM accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use ES Modules to structure our code into separate, maintainable
        components. Data representing listings will be organized as Objects
        within Arrays, allowing us to leverage array methods such as forEach,
        map, filter, and reduce for efficient data manipulation. DOM interaction
        will be achieved by selecting elements (e.g., filter inputs and display
        containers), modifying them in response to user events, and dynamically
        updating the view as users interact with sorting and filtering controls.

      <p>
        Zurplus is a sustainable, nonprofit resource-sharing platform dedicated
        to transforming waste into valuable resources. Our platform connects
        businesses with leftover materials to those who can repurpose them,
        driving the circular economy forward by reducing waste and promoting
        innovative recycling practices.
      </p>
      <p>Our Mission</p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to empower companies to view surplus materials as
        opportunities rather than waste. By fostering collaboration among large
        manufacturing companies, startups, SMEs, community groups, and local
        governments, Zurplus strives to build a greener, more sustainable
        future—one where every discarded resource is given a new purpose.
      </p>
      <p>Vision</p>
      <p>
        We envision a world where the circular economy is the standard, not the
        exception. Our goal is to revolutionize waste management on a global
        scale, starting in the United States, expanding throughout America, and
        eventually reaching every corner of the globe. We believe that by
        embracing innovative resource-sharing practices, we can create lasting
        environmental and economic benefits for generations to come.
